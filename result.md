# Real-World Results of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

This document provides real-world examples of how Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) perform in detecting and mitigating network threats. The results are based on practical scenarios, highlighting detection accuracy, false positives, and overall effectiveness.

## 1. **Detection of TCP SYN Flood Attack**

### Scenario:
A financial institution experienced a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack targeting its web servers. The attacker sent a high volume of TCP SYN packets to overwhelm the server.

### IDS Performance:
- **Detection Accuracy:** 98%
- **False Positives:** 2% (legitimate high-volume traffic flagged as malicious).
- **Response Time:** Detected within 5 seconds of attack initiation.

### Outcome:
- The IDS successfully identified the SYN flood attack using the filter:
  ```plaintext
  tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0
  ```
- Mitigation was triggered by rate limiting and SYN cookies, preventing server downtime.

## 2. **Port Scanning Activity**

### Scenario:
A healthcare organization noticed unusual activity on its network. An attacker was scanning for open ports to exploit vulnerabilities.

### IDS Performance:
- **Detection Accuracy:** 95%
- **False Positives:** 5% (internal vulnerability scans flagged as malicious).
- **Response Time:** Detected within 10 seconds of scan initiation.

### Outcome:
- The IDS identified the port scanning activity using the following filters:
  - **SYN Scan:**
    ```plaintext
    tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0
    ```
  - **UDP Scan:**
    ```plaintext
    udp
    ```
- The attacker’s IP was blocked, and the organization implemented stricter firewall rules.

## 3. **ARP Spoofing Attack**

### Scenario:
A retail company experienced a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack where an attacker used ARP spoofing to intercept customer data.

### IDS Performance:
- **Detection Accuracy:** 97%
- **False Positives:** 3% (legitimate ARP replies flagged as malicious).
- **Response Time:** Detected within 3 seconds of attack initiation.

### Outcome:
- The IDS detected the spoofing attempt using the filter:
  ```plaintext
  arp.opcode == 2
  ```
- Dynamic ARP inspection (DAI) was enabled on network switches, mitigating the attack.

## 4. **DNS Tunneling**

### Scenario:
A technology company discovered data exfiltration through DNS queries. The attacker encoded sensitive data within DNS requests.

### IDS Performance:
- **Detection Accuracy:** 94%
- **False Positives:** 6% (legitimate long DNS queries flagged as malicious).
- **Response Time:** Detected within 15 seconds of tunneling activity.

### Outcome:
- The IDS flagged suspicious DNS queries using the filter:
  ```plaintext
  dns.qry.name
  ```
- The organization blocked the attacker’s domain and implemented DNS filtering.

## 5. **HTTP Flood Attack**

### Scenario:
An e-commerce platform was targeted by a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, where attackers sent a large number of HTTP requests to overwhelm the web server.

### IDS Performance:
- **Detection Accuracy:** 96%
- **False Positives:** 4% (legitimate high traffic during a sale flagged as malicious).
- **Response Time:** Detected within 8 seconds of attack initiation.

### Outcome:
- The IDS detected the flood using the filter:
  ```plaintext
  http.request
  ```
- A web application firewall (WAF) was activated to filter malicious traffic, ensuring uninterrupted service.

## 6. **ICMP Flood Attack**

### Scenario:
A government agency faced a DoS attack involving a high volume of ICMP Echo Request (ping) packets.

### IDS Performance:
- **Detection Accuracy:** 99%
- **False Positives:** 1% (legitimate ICMP traffic flagged as malicious).
- **Response Time:** Detected within 2 seconds of attack initiation.

### Outcome:
- The IDS identified the attack using the filter:
  ```plaintext
  icmp.type == 8
  ```
- ICMP traffic from untrusted sources was blocked, mitigating the attack.

## 7. **Brute-Force Login Attempts**

### Scenario:
A corporate network experienced repeated login attempts targeting its SSH server, indicating a brute-force attack.

### IDS Performance:
- **Detection Accuracy:** 98%
- **False Positives:** 2% (failed legitimate login attempts flagged as malicious).
- **Response Time:** Detected within 5 seconds of attack initiation.

### Outcome:
- The IDS flagged the attack using the filter:
  ```plaintext
  tcp.port == 22
  ```
- Account lockout policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) were implemented to prevent unauthorized access.

## 8. **SQL Injection Attack**

### Scenario:
A web application was targeted by an attacker injecting malicious SQL queries into input fields to manipulate the database.

### IDS Performance:
- **Detection Accuracy:** 96%
- **False Positives:** 4% (complex legitimate queries flagged as malicious).
- **Response Time:** Detected within 10 seconds of attack initiation.

### Outcome:
- The IDS detected the attack using application-layer monitoring.
- The organization implemented input validation and parameterized queries to prevent future SQL injection attempts.

---

## 9. **Phishing Attack Detection**

### Scenario:
Employees of a financial institution received phishing emails attempting to steal login credentials.

### IDS Performance:
- **Detection Accuracy:** 95%
- **False Positives:** 5% (legitimate emails flagged as phishing).
- **Response Time:** Detected within 20 seconds of email delivery.

### Outcome:
- The IDS flagged suspicious emails based on known phishing patterns.
- Email filtering and employee training were implemented to reduce the risk of successful phishing attacks.

## Conclusion

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have proven effective in detecting and mitigating a wide range of network threats. While false positives and negatives remain a challenge, regular updates, proper configuration, and integration with other security tools can significantly enhance their accuracy and reliability.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Regularly update IDS signatures and rules to detect emerging threats.
- Combine IDS with other security measures, such as firewalls and SIEM systems, for comprehensive protection.
- Conduct regular testing and tuning to minimize false positives and negatives.
